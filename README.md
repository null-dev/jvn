# JavaVisualNovel (JVN)
JavaVisualNovel is a Java framework for creating visual novels based ob LibGDX. It is NOT currently a library and since most code must be written directly in the project, it is more like a template. Treat JVN like a typical LibGDX game except with some helper code that you can use start off your novel.
